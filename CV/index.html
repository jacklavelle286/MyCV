                training to become a fully-certified AWS Instructor, so I can share my love of AWS with others. I am on the way to completing all 11 AWS Certifications also! I love learning about new technology, long distance cycling, writing, reading,
playing drums, listening to music, going to live concerts and hiking. I am currently training to run 6
marathons this year also.
