                I am a 3x AWS Certified Professional, with a track record of solving problems effectively. I am also currently
                training to become a fully-certified AWS Instructor, so I can share my love of AWS with others. I have also recently accepted my dream job as a TAM at AWS! I am also on the way to completing all 11 AWS Certifications! I love learning about new technology, long distance cycling, writing, reading,
playing drums, listening to music, going to live concerts and hiking. I am currently training to run 6
marathons this year also. I am also writing a blog about AWS, read it <a href="https://lavellej286.medium.com/" target="_blank">here!</a> I also love posting to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F-jack-lavelle-%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F-096493183/" target="_blank">LinkedIn!</a> and I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTQdqf2xrPtsZCZG-eghq7A" target="_blank">YouTube!</a> channel in which I aim to inspire others who are starting their cloud journey.
